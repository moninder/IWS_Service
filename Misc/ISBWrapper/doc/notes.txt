Notes on the IWSWrapper DLL
October 2012




For Audit,

- we will pass in the number of days to set the audit date age threshold 
- basic flow:
	
				// 1 - get badges to audit 
						uses SP [App.Sbo].[IWS.GetBadgesToAudit]
						selects badges that have never been audited and badges whose AuditDate > @threshold days ago
				// 2 - for each badge to audit
				// 2.3 - get BOAA provisioning data for badge
				// 2.1 - get the CMS provisioning data for the badge
					FAIL if either (or both!) sides don't have data
				// 2.2 - set badge to WAITING and LastTransmitted to today
				// 2.4 - compare CMS prov data with BOAA prov data
					NOTE: WE ARE NOT AUDITING PIN OR POSITION
					FAIL if AccessType or ActiveDate or ExpireDate differ in any way
					FAIL if data from either side is missing 
					PASS if CMS prov data matches BOAA prov data
	
	Upon FAIL, UPDATE [Data].[Audit.CMSBadges], SET Status = -1, Note = 'the reason it failed', LastAudited = GETDATE()
	Upon PASS, UPDATE [Data].[Audit.CMSBadges], SET Status = 1, Note = '', LastAudited = GETDATE()  (clears out old fail notes)

·5 - EBTS File - contains a mix of biometric and non biometric.
·10 - Face- biometric
·11 - Fingerprint - biometric
·12 - Document (EBTS related) ???
·13 – Iris- biometric









14 - PIN is not returned...



Item 6 Get Picture 
- what doc type is a 'picture'.  
- is a picture considered a 'non-biometric' document?


Item 10   Revoke CMS badge by BOAA Badge ID
- need some good BOAA BadgeID for testing - none of the ones I am trying are found.

Item 14   GetProvisioningAuditData
- need some good BOAA BadgeID for testing - none of the ones I am trying are found.

Item 16 "GetPersonInfoForBadge" a.k.a "Who owns this badge?"
- need some good BOAA BadgeID for testing - none of the ones I am trying are found.



Item 17  "GetCardIDsForPerson" a.k.a. "Get all cards" a.k.a. "CMSGetBOAACardIDsByPersonGUID"
- modified signature is 
	public IBMAPerson CMSGetBOAACardIDsByPersonGUID(int systemID, string personGUID)
Why is systemID necessary?


Item 20 "GetNonBiometricDocuments"
- need a list of all NON-BIOMETRIC doc types and a list of all docs types




Item 6 "Return picture"
- DOCM
- not implemented
- special case of item 20

Item 12 "Reprovision"
- CMS
- when provisioning data changes on BOAA side, tell IWS that they need to get ACAMS updated.
- not implemented

Item 14 "Audit"
- (CMS) BOAA calls CMS to get list of doors provisioned for the passed CMS_CardID and BOAA_BadgeID
- not implemented  
- Spec says it returns "doors provisioned for that badgeID"


Item 16 "GetPersonInfoForBadge" a.k.a "Who owns this badge?"
- (CMS) BOAA calls CMS with a BOAA_BadgeID and CMS returns person info. 
- not implemented

- Spec says it returns list of CMS_CardIDs (which are ints)


Item 18 "GetPersonDocuments"
- (DOCM)  BOAA calls DOCM to get a list of all docs associated with the specified PersonGUID
- partially implemented - we are calling into DOCM and getting the list of documents, but need to know what to do with it.
- Need to define a return type - spec says it returns list of 'documents' (assume we only want docname, type)
