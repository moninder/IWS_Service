Notes on the ACAM SSIS export to PP process
February 2013

===================
Initialization
===================

1) Add Stored Procedure: [App.Sbo].[SSIS.AccessControlTransfers.Insert] 
   This procedure inserts records into the Access Control Tables when 
   records are added or changed in Badges, Divisions and Persons tables 
   (hmm, should it have been on the Biographics table instead?)

   - file: SSISAccessControlTransfersInsert.sql


2) Add a call to the proc within the following after update table triggers
   - files:

     Badges
     Divisions
     PersonBiographics


3) Project.params
   This file contains the following 4 parameters which need to be correctly initialized
   - run_mode
     values: dev, production

   - log_dir
     the path to the folder where you want the log files created

   - Telnet_Client_Path:
     the path to Plink

   - Telnet_Connection:
     Plink connection string

   NOTE: Ignore the database connection parameters in this file. They are obsolete.
         The connection strings are managed in the connection manager files below!

   NOTE: ACAMPackageConfig.dtsConfig
   - Ignore: went with the project.params file and connection manager files instead


4) SSIS connection manager files
   - CS.conmgr:             connection string for CS BOSD data
   - PicturePErfectInformix.conmgr: connection string for Picture Perfect data via an ODBC DSN

5) ODBC DSN
   - In order to connect to the informix Picture Perfect database, each client requiring a connection needs to 
     install the IBM Informix device driver. The sdk install exe, installclientsdk.exe, can be downloaded from 
     http://www.ciscounitytools.com/Applications/CxN/InformixODBC/InformixODBC.html via the link: 
     o IBM Informix Client SDK Install 3.70 TC5 for all 32 and 64 bit Windows Systems. Download Now (ZIP file - unpack and run install) 

     You will need to register with IBM.

     This is a 32 bit driver, so on 64 bit machines, you 1st need to jump through the following hoop:

     1.Open a Windows command window ('cmd') 
     2.run: "set PATH=C:\WINDOWS\SysWOW64\;%PATH%" 
     3.Run the setup.exe for IBM Informix Client SDK 

     To confirm that the Informix 32-bit ODBC driver has been installed run: 
     "C:\windows\syswow64\odbcad32.exe" and look under the Drivers tab. 

     If the above step did not work, you must change the System variable so any child process would also pick the new PATH. 
     That would allow any child process to have the C:\WINDOWS\SYSWOW64 prefix in the PATH. 

     If you need it, you may restore the value of the PATH environment variable after the CSDK/IConnect installation.  
     Control Panel -> System -> Advanced (tab) -> Environment Variable button 


     Once you can confirm that the device driver is available, create a 32 bit ODBC DSN accordingly:
     1) Add iws03gcr to your windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts file
         192.168.16.51   iws03gcr #       Picture Perfect server

     2) The Informix server folks will need to add –your- IP address to their hosts file:    
         I passed along as 192.168.60.127 my address.

     3) In my case, I needed to disable my personal windows firewall so they could see my machine.

     4) Add sqlexec to your windows/system32/drivers/etc/services file:
         sqlexec           9088/tcp       #Informix Database

     5) Create the system DSN: 
         run C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe

         server : iws03gcr
         Host Name: 192.168.16.51
         Service: sqlexec
         Protocol: onsoctp
         DB Name: proteus
         un: informix
         pw: informix


IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: 
Needed to set the following project property in order to allow the use of the 32 bit ODBC.dll as required by the informix 32 bit driver.
The impact is that when we set up the SQL ALERT job, we need to include the full path to the 32 bit ?????

===================
Source Code:
===================

	Application
	-------------------
	Location: $/Credentialing_System/Dev/Misc/SSISPpExport

	Database
	-------------------
        Tables: 
		[Data].[AccessControl].[TransferDivisions]
		[Data].[AccessControl].[TransferPersons]
		[Data].[AccessControl][.Transfers]

	Procedures:
		[App.Sbo].[SSIS.AccessControlTransfers.Insert]

========================
Unresolved Issues:
========================
The sql calls to informix really do not like to receive NULL as a parameter value.
Not sure if this is due to the informix ODBC driver, or if there is a configuration setting to avoid translations or what.


PLINK has not been tested and is commented out.
