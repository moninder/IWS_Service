Notes on the ACAM SSIS export to PP process
March 2013

====================================================================
 Flag records to be exported within 'AirportIQ'
====================================================================
A record is inserted into SSIS.AccessControlTransfer* tables whenever 
a Badge, Division or PersonBiographics record is inserted or updated
unless an unprocessed record exists.

-  A stored procedure, [App.Sbo].[SSIS.AccessControlTransfers.Insert], 
   is executed within the after update trigger behind each of the 
   3 tables. This procedure inserts records into the appropriate 
   Access Control Tables:
   - AccessControl.Transfers: houses the unique TransferID and processing status info
   - AccessControl.TransferPersons: houses PersonBiographic record key etc
   - AccessControl.TransferDivisions: houses Division (aka Department) record key etc
   - AccessControl.TransferBadges: houses Badge record key etc
   
====================================================================
 Execute the SSIS package
====================================================================
A to-be-created Sql Agent job will be scheduled to run (frequency?)
The job will execute the SSIS export package.

====================================================================
 SSIS Package - Process steps
====================================================================
Unprocessed AccessControl.Transfers records are collected.

For each record, 
- AccessControl.Transfers.TransmitStart timestamp is 
  populated when the record processing initiates.
  
- AccessControl.Transfers.TransmitEnd timestamp is 
  populated when *successful* processing completes
  for all related AccessControl.Transfers* table records.
  IE Their [WhenTransmitted] dates are populated.
  

Processing behavior is conditional based on the type or record and action:

- Division:
    Find match in PicturePerfect.department table matching on division.
	
	If PP Department exists, update description, location, manager, 
	    phone, user1, user2, facility, modify_date, modify_time
	Else insert new Department record
	
	UPDATE [Data].[AccessControl.TransferDivisions].[WhenTransmitted] value.
	
- PersonBiographics
	Find match in PicturePerfect.person table matching on employee id alone. 
	(note that this may update multiple records)
	
	If PP Person exists, 
	  update person record with person, pin, first_name, last_name, initials, 
	    title, address1,  address2, address3, address4, address5, phone, 
	    modify_date, modify_time
	  update person_user record with description, modify_date, modify_time
	    match on person_id AND slot_number
		
	Else insert new Person record and 
	     insert new Person_user record
	
	UPDATE [Data].[AccessControl.TransferPersons].[WhenTransmitted] value.
	
- Badges:
	Find match in PicturePerfect.badge table matching on bid
	
	If PP Badge exists, 	
		if department does not exist in pp, create the record in pp
		if person does not exist in pp, create the record in pp
		update badge record with description, person_id, return_date, 
		   return_time, return_tz, status, modify_date, modify_time
		   
	Else insert new Badge record
	
	UPDATE [Data].[AccessControl.TransferBadges].[WhenTransmitted] value.
	
- NOTE: BadgeCategories and Categories sections of the code are commented out!!!
