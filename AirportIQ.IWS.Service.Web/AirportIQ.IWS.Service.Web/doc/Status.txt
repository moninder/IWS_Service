Status for IWS Web Service
Atchison - September 2012


In the table below, I estimate the hours needed to scope, estimate, design, develop and document each task.
Tasks are enumerated in "New IDSB Interface Requirement Definition v0.8.xlsx"
A complete discussion of the applicable tasks (and the specs I developed for them) is in Notes.txt.

8,8					T02 - Biometric Update

							NOTE: There is nothing that has to happen in the db to reflect that capture is complete.  
							I ultimately removed this interface from the webservice.
8,8					T05 - Update BadgeID (was Card Status)
